# Trick or Treat

## Description

Trick or Treat is a game where the player has to move horizontally and catch the candy that falls from the top on the basket. The game ends when the player catches a rotten apple.

//After that, a score is calculated based on how many candy the player has collected.

"Get ready for Halloween! Just grab your Halloween pumpkin and use the <- and -> arrows to catch all the candy, but watch out! rotten apples are also in the mix! Don't catch them unless you want the game to be over!
Good luck!"
